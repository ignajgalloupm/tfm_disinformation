They are distributed in an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Siwa Oasis in Egypt , and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Niger River . Historically , they spoke Berber languages , which together form the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family . Since the Muslim conquest of North Africa in the seventh century , a large number of Berbers inhabiting the Maghreb have acquired different degrees of knowledge of varieties of the languages of North Africa . After the colonization of North Africa by France , `` the French government succeeded in integrating the French language in Algeria by making French the official national language and requiring all education to take place in French . '' Foreign languages , mainly French and to some degree Spanish , inherited from former European colonial powers , are used by most educated Berbers in Algeria and Morocco in some formal contexts , such as higher education or business .   Today , most Berber people live in North Africa , mainly in Libya , Algeria , and Morocco ; Small Berber populations are also found in Niger , Mali , Mauritania , Tunisia , Burkina Faso and Egypt , as well as large immigrant communities living in France , Canada , Belgium , the Netherlands , Germany , and other countries of Europe .   The majority of Berbers are predominantly Sunni Muslim . The Berber identity is usually wider than language and ethnicity , and encompasses the entire history and geography of North Africa . Berbers are not an entirely homogeneous ethnicity and they encompass a range of phenotypes , societies and ancestries . The unifying forces for the Berber people may be their shared language , or a collective identification with Berber heritage and history .   There are some twenty-five to thirty million Berber speakers in North Africa . The number of ethnic Berbers -LRB- including non-Berber speakers -RRB- is far greater , as a large part of the Berbers have acquired other languages over the course of many decades or centuries , and no longer speak Berber today . The majority of North Africa 's population is believed to be Berber in origin , although due to Arabization most ethnic Berbers identify as Arabized Berbers .   Berbers call themselves some variant of the word i-Mazigh-en -LRB- singular : a-Mazigh -RRB- , possibly meaning `` free people '' or `` noble men '' . The name likely had its ancient parallel in the Roman and Greek names for Berbers , Mazices . Some of the best known of the ancient Berbers are the Numidian king Masinissa , king Jugurtha , the Berber-Roman author Apuleius , Saint Augustine of Hippo , and the Berber-Roman general Lusius Quietus , who was instrumental in defeating the major wave of Jewish revolts of 115 -- 117 . Dihya or Kahina was a religious and military leader who led a fierce Berber resistance against the Arab-Muslim expansion in Northwest Africa . Kusaila was a seventh-century leader of the Awraba tribe of the Berber people and King of the Sanhadja confederation . Yusuf ibn Tashfin was king of the Berber Almoravid empire ; Tariq ibn Ziyad the general who conquered Hispania ; Abbas Ibn Firnas , a prolific inventor and early pioneer in aviation ; Ibn Battuta , a medieval explorer who traveled the longest known distances of his time . \"}, vector=None, shard_key=None)]\n",
